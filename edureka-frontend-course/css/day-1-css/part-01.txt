        how to style any element in css->
           Inorder to style any eleme with css we have the select the element through selector.

           1. selector:
            1.>  id and class selector
             id ->identity, so for a html element its id value will always be unique , not two element can have same id value 

             2->  class -> it helps us to identify the element but this value is not unique  to a element -> two or more element can have same class.

3-> tagname selector
    tagname{
        properties
    }
